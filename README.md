Open ABAGAIL-master as an intellij project

For PART ONE:
  
  Open Assignment two and run the program with the corresponding command arguments:
    
    RHC: hidden layers, iterations, RHC
    Genetic Alg: hidden layers, iterations, ga, population, mating rate, mutation rate
    Simulated Annealing: hidden layers, iteractions, sa, temperature, cooling rate
  
  Training and testing errors, runtime, and overall accuracy will be printed to the command line and saved in excel files.
  
For PART TWO:
  
  Run:
    
    knapsacktest.java
    flipfloptest.java
    travelingsalesmantest.java
  
  Each algorithm's fitness level will be saved to an excel sheet in 100 iteration increments. The runtime and fitness evaluations will be printed to the command line in the following order: RHC, SA, GA and MIMIC
